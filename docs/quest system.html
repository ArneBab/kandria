Each quest has a number of tasks that should be completed in order to complete the quest, and each task has a number of triggers it can spawn into the world.</p><h2 id="quest">Quest</h2><p>A quest is a simple construct that has a description of itself for the player's logbook, a set of total tasks associated with it, and a number of tasks that are activated when the quest itself is activated.</p><p>Quests should be used for bigger overarching story beats, analogous to chapters in a traditional story. A quest can contain branching narrative within its tasks, and multiple quests may be active at the same time.</p><h2 id="task">Task</h2><p>A task is much more involved and the primary workhorse that outlines the narrative structure of the game. Each task has a short description (<code>:description</code>) and title (<code>:title</code>) for the player to read, a set of triggers that are activated when this task is activated (<code>:on-activate</code>), a condition that causes the task to be completed if fulfilled (<code>:condition</code>), an invariant that causes the task to be failed if unfulfilled (<code>:invariant</code>), and a set of triggers that are activated if the task is completed (<code>:on-complete</code>).</p><p>While the game is running a task can be in one of the following states:</p><ul><li><p><strong>inactive</strong><br>The task has not been activated yet and is not currently relevant to the story.</p></li><li><p><strong>unresolved</strong><br>The task is currently active but has not been completed yet.</p></li><li><p><strong>completed</strong><br>The task has been completed successfully and is now no longer relevant.</p></li><li><p><strong>failed</strong><br>The task can no longer be completed and has been automatically failed.</p></li><li><p><strong>obsolete</strong><br>Another task that lead to the same outcome has been completed, rendering this task obsolete and no longer relevant.</p></li></ul><p>Tasks are strung together to form a non-linear narrative by having a task cause multiple other tasks. </p><p>Multiple tasks can also cause the same task, in which case they become alternative ways of advancing the plot. As soon as the player completes one of the possible tasks, the others become obsoleted.</p><p>The task condition allows more complex behaviours to trigger completion of a task outside of dialogue. The task invariant allows you to ensure tasks only remain active while they can still be completed in a sensible fashion. Both the condition and invariant can be arbitrary <a class="external-link" href="lisp crash course.html">Lisp code</a>.</p><h2 id="triggers">Triggers</h2><p>Triggers are an abstract concept for &quot;things that happen when tasks change state&quot;. Triggers come in a couple of different types, outlined here.</p><h3 id="quests and tasks">Quests and Tasks</h3><p>Quests and tasks can act as triggers themselves, and will simply become active when triggered.</p><h3 id="interactions">Interactions</h3><p>An interaction is a piece of dialogue that the player can initiate with a particular NPC or item. The set of active quests determines the set of available interactions with the NPCs and items, allowing you to control relevant dialogue and story. Each interaction should have an <code>:interactable</code> that it is attached to, and a <code>:title</code> that is used to display to the user in a menu when multiple interactions are possible.</p><p>See the <a class="external-link" href="dialogue format.html">dialogue format</a> documentation for more information on how dialogue is written.</p><h3 id="actions">Actions</h3><p>An action executes a piece of arbitrary <a class="external-link" href="lisp crash course.html">Lisp code</a> when activated or deactivated. This can be useful to do things such as spawning items and enemies, giving the player rewards, etc.</p><h2 id="variable bindings">Variable Bindings</h2><p>The entire storyline, as well as each quest, task, and interaction can specify a set of variable bindings (<code>:variables</code>). This should be a list of bindings like so: <code>(a (b T) (c :something))</code> which would bind three variables, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, each being set to <code>NIL</code>, <code>T</code>, and <code>:something</code> respectively.</p><p>Bindings follow the same scoping as outlined above. This means that when accessing a variable (through <code>var</code>), first the bindings of the closest relevant structure are used (typically an interaction). If no binding matches the requested name, the parent is considered instead, all the way up to the storyline.</p><p>If a variable is retrieved that does not exist, <code>NIL</code> is returned on read, and a new binding is created on the closest relevant structure on write. Writing variables that were not previously declared is bad style however, and a warning will be logged as a consequence.</p><h2 id="updating state live">Updating State Live</h2><p>You can redefine quests, tasks, and triggers while the game is running. Changes to existing structures should reflect immediately.</p><p>If you want to change the status of a structure, you should use <code>quest:update</code>. You can simply type out a form in any Lisp file and use the recompile command to get it going. After recompiling it should also print the updated state of the quest system, showing only active items.</p><h2 id="sequence quests">Sequence Quests</h2><p>Often it is useful to define a simple sequence of tasks within a linear quest. This can be done much more conveniently using <code>define-sequence-quest</code>. Here's two simple examples:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block"><pre>;; 1. Go to cave
;; 2. Find mushroom
;; 3. Hand in mushroom
(define-sequence-quest (kandria mushrooms)
  :title &quot;Get some mushrooms&quot;
  (:go-to (cave)
   :title &quot;Go to cave&quot;
   &quot;
   ~ catherine
   | Good luck out there!&quot;)
  (:have (item:mushroom 10)
   :title &quot;Find mushroom&quot;)
  (:interact (catherine)
   :title &quot;Return the mushroom&quot;
   &quot;
   ~ catherine
   | Thanks!&quot;))

;; 1. Go to first leak
;; 2. Listen to interaction
;; 3. Defeat enemies
;; 4. Go to second leak
;; 5. Defeat enemies
;; 6. Listen to interaction
(define-sequence-quest (kandria leak)
  :title &quot;a&quot;
  (:go-to (leak1 :lead catherine)
   :title &quot;go to leak&quot;
   &quot;| A&quot;)
  (:interact (catherine :now T)
   &quot;| Stuff&quot;)
  (:complete (spawner)
   :title &quot;Defeat the enemies&quot;)
  (:go-to (leak2 :lead catherine)
   :title &quot;go to leak 2&quot;
   &quot;| Stufff&quot;)
  (:complete (spawner2)
   :title &quot;Defeat the enemies&quot;)
  (:interact (catherine :now T)
   &quot;| Stuff&quot;))</pre></code><p>A sequence is defined as a list of clauses, with each clause defining a task with one or more triggers. The following clauses are recognised:</p><ul><li><p><code>:have (item &amp;optional count)</code><br>Check whether the player has the given item type in the inventory. The optional count lets you specify a minimum number, too.</p></li><li><p><code>:go-to (place &amp;key lead follow)</code><br>Have the player go to a certain location. Optionally can also specify an NPC that should lead the player there or follow them there. The task will auto-complete once the player is near the place. <br>The body can be a piece of dialogue that will play as walk-n-talk once the task starts.</p></li><li><p><code>:interact (interactable &amp;key now)</code><br>Check for the completion of a piece of dialogue. The body must be a dialogue script that will be turned into an  interaction. If <code>now</code> is set to true, the interaction will trigger immediately once the task is triggered without requiring the player to do anything.</p></li><li><p><code>:complete (thing)</code><br>Check for the completion of a trigger or spawner. The resulting task will activate the trigger or spawner.<br>Similar to <code>:go-to</code> the body can be a piece of dialogue that will play as walk-n-talk once the task starts.</p></li><li><p><code>:eval</code><br>Simply evaluate the body of code unconditionally and immediately move on to the next task.</p></li><li><p><code>:nearby (place character)</code><br>The task only completes once the character is near the specified place, similar to <code>:go-to</code>.<br>The body can be arbitrary forms that should be executed once the character is nearby.</p></li><li><p><code>:wait seconds</code><br>Wait for the specified number of seconds before continuing with the next task.</p></li></ul></article>
