You must be in voice communication with the player.</p><p>You should always use a recent build of the game, unless the latest build is obviously broken in some sense. Contact Nick for a fresh build.</p><h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2><p>Before the test begins, you should ensure that the player can launch the game and can input things properly. If the tester is new to the game, you should introduce them to the game only briefly by mentioning the game's title, genre, and general themes (sci-fi, post-apocalypse). You should also encourage the player to use a gamepad controller, as keyboard controls are far from ideal.</p><h2 id="the test">The Test</h2><p>Once the test begins, you should not intervene or tell the player anything, unless the player gets stuck or lost for a long time, or encounters a fatal bug. If the player is lost, remind them briefly on how to continue in the questline, or give them short hints. If they get stuck and cannot beat a certain section, introduce them to the <code>noclip</code> and <code>god</code> cheats. These cheats can be activated on the keyboard by simply typing them out.</p><p>During the test you should closely observe the gameplay and the player themselves. Particularly note if they get visibly or audibly annoyed or confused at any part of the game. Also note if they cause any form of glitch, even if they continue with the game without noting the glitch. In detail, you should also observe whether they make full use of the core moveset (climbing, dashing, crawling, heavy attacks, light attacks, quick menu). If they cannot remember certain moves, or only stick primarily to a select flew, please note this as well. Especially note any questions the player may have had at any point in the game, narrative or otherwise.</p><p>If the session is in person, it is best if you write your observations down on a physical notepad of some kind, and then transfer them to a digital form in the Feedback doc later. If the session is remote, you may type them down directly, though keeping things short during the session and editing it to be more complete later is recommended, as you may miss additional things while you're writing something down.</p><p>It is recommended to keep the session to no more than an hour and a half, though you or the player may also end the session early should other problems arise.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Once the test session has ended for whatever reason, be that out of lack of time, fatigue, or a fatal bug, you should encourage the player to fill out the following Google form:</p><p><blockquote><p><a href="https://forms.gle/EEptCsTtugCEukTm6">https://forms.gle/EEptCsTtugCEukTm6</a></p></blockquote></p><p>You should read through the Google form above ahead of time so you know what questions are posed and how to lead the player through them should they get confused.</p><p>As with the test, try not to influence the tester unless they clearly do not understand a question. Once they've filled out the form completely, you should thank them for their time, and ask them if they'd be up for another playtest session at a later date.</p></article></body>
