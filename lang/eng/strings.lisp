The android's genera system had experienced a sudden critical
failure, leading it to suddenly turn and kill whoever was in sight.

The failure escalated, destabilising the internal fusion core,
and approximately 1.256 seconds after the initial failure,
the entire valley was wiped out in a massive fireball.

Good job!"

With Zelah defeated, the Wraw chain of command quickly fell apart.
The valley entered an uneasy state of peace, but peace it was
nevertheless.

Good job!"
