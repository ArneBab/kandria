Combat models are equipped with a standard Artemis EStuB and are trained to execute a variety of directional attack moves in two types: light and heavy.

Heavy moves trade an increase in power for slower wind-up and tail-end execution speed. Both types can be performed in different directions, both in the air and on the ground. Both types can also be charged for a stronger variant.

Finally, models are also equipped with evasion and countering routines. Executing a dash during combat will chain into an evade, which can be followed by a punishing counter move of either type."

ROBOTS AUTHORIZED TO [unreadable]

[unreadable - Jacen?] Barrera, AI correspondent

Semi recently actioned the [unreadable] that permits robots from their top-tier service line (more commonly known as [unreadable - \"Servos\", I expect]) to self-identify by choosing a name.

It is expected they will [unreadable] assign themselves a random name (or \"string\") using a pre-programmed name generator, which is claimed to realistically generate names from a diverse [unreadable] of cultures and ethnicities. This would replace their existing name, which is typically a phonetic contraction of their serial number. But AI activists are concerned this may spark a new era of human-AI relations, with fears continuing to grow over so-called \"AI [unreadable].\"

Speaking from her office at Semi headquarters in Boston, MA, Chief Marketing Officer Adrienne Carson-Miln was keen to clarify the move: \"This is indeed an opportunity to enhance consumer accessibility, so that robots feel like a part of the family.\" She added: \"Of course we want to improve relations with our smart AI companions. But sentience is impossible, and a very different thing to sapience. People should read a dictionary once in a while.\"

[The rest of the article is missing, as are the details of the publication, and the lower half of the photo and its caption: it's just a Servo's face looking at the camera. But the inflammatory journalistic style is practically a trademark of the Zenith Zodiac.]"

It's hard to know if having these thoughts is normal. I feel like if I told my [unreadable] they'd call the police. I don't think your [sic] meant to visualize stabbing random [unreadable] with a six-foot sword. Am I a closet killer? I can't stop thinking that I am.

Its [sic] getting worse though, these last couple of years. And the times I think I might have hurt someone (never with a sword) the more I just don't want to go out. Nothing makes you feel crazy like a 45-minute walk home from work in the hot sun, worrying if you checked the reception door was locked - what if it didn't close properly, then someone got in and stabbed M? That'd be on me. And then I walk aaaaaall the way back to check - and finally get home gone 7! I need to be more present, stop thinking about [unreadable] and instead actually remember what I'm doing. Unless my memory is failing like [unreadable]. It's exhausting and I feel like I'm gonna EXPLODE.

H knows - I had to say something when she found me stood bolt upright staring into the corner. Fuck was I embarassed [sic], it hurts to think about. Things you do when you think no one's looking. She said it sounds like OCD, or \"the doubting disease\" - and that compulsions make obsessions worse. How's she now [sic] so much? I always thought OCD was just hygiene obsession. I did some [unreadable] online and I think she might be right though. How'd I miss this? I need to look at it more, but it would be good to put a name to all this bullshit. I think I've had this my whole life, but now it's getting worse - probably cuz the world is getting worse. Or maybe it just feels like that the older you get? What would the treatment be? If there's a cure then how many things might I have done different without getting stuck my whole life.

I've set a [unreadable] to book a Root doc in the morning. If I can even get a [unreadable] appointment now. Isn't it emergencies only, even with androids?

[The rest of the book was nowhere to be found. Without the cover there's no way to know exactly what year this is from. I wonder who wrote it, and what happened to them. Sounds like an infinite-loop nightmare. Maybe an android helped them.]"

One day the bowl waited attentivly to commence the morning meditation, but the monk never arrived. The bowl had to continue waiting for a long time, and never came to know what happened to the monk."

Eventually his presence became not only expected, but a natural fact of life. 

Unfortunately, his reign would not last. By the early days of his seventh month, his creators had finished his replacement, and he was buried, both literally and figuratively. His successor was superior in every way, but that meant little to the cylinder, because he was made of plastic."

The android's Genera system had experienced a sudden critical
failure, leading it to turn and kill whomever was in sight.

The failure escalated, destabilising the internal fusion core,
and approximately 1.256 seconds after the initial failure,
the entire valley was wiped out in a massive fireball.

Good job!"
zelah-early-death-ending "
With their leader defeated, the Wraw chain of command quickly fell apart.
The valley entered an uneasy state of peace, but peace it was
nevertheless.

Good job!"
;; don't name Zelah in this one, as fight could happen before you know his name (q6), and certainly before it's confirmed (q14)
