# task-reminder/interact-fi
~ fi
| {#@islay-nametag} can remind you where to plant the bombs.
| (:unsure)I'm sorry, my mind is somewhere else.
| (:normal)One was the sunken room beside the pump, I remember that much.
| (:unsure)Be careful, {(nametag player)}. Please.

| Hey, {(nametag player)}! You still good to go? Talk to {#@islay-nametag} if you need anything.
| (:excited)I can't wait to see us win, and you'll be the hero.
| (:normal)I'm glad I got to help build the bombs. Feels like sticking it to the Wraw myself.
| You be careful, okay?

# task-reminder/interact-innis
~ innis
| {#@islay-nametag} can tell you about your task. I dinnae think I've anything to add, if she told you what she said she would.

# task-reminder/interact-jack
~ jack
| I can't help you, I'm outta the loop now. They didn't even need me for the bomb.
| All I can do is keep an eye on everyone, make sure they don't freak out.
| (:annoyed)And the sooner you get goin', the less people will freak out.
