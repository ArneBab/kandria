| (:concerned){#@islay-nametag}, you're soaking wet.
~ islay
| (:nervous)Dammit... You shouldn't have come. I can handle this.
~ player
- Let us help.
  ~ catherine
  | We can do this together. (:excited)And save time.
- We're more efficient together.
  ~ catherine
  | (:excited)Right. What she said.
- The hell you can.
  ~ catherine
  | (:concerned){(nametag player)}'s right. Let us help you.
~ islay
| (:nervous)...
| This "bomb has been defused"(orange)...
| (:normal)But I think "I can rewire its receiver"(orange).
| They've got a "bomb disposal mech"(orange) - I saw "one heading into the pump room"(orange).
| Since you're here now you can "destroy the mech"(orange).
| Do that "then go to the bomb in the Brother offices. {#@catherine-nametag}, you can rewire it"(orange).
~ catherine
| (:excited)Got it.
~ islay
| When I'm done "I'll go to the one beyond the hospital apartments"(orange).
| And {(nametag player)}, for what it's worth: I don't think you're a traitor.
| Now, please: I need to work.
~ catherine
| I can go to the Brother offices while you take care of the mech.
~ player
- We should stick together.
- Getting yourself killed won't help us.
- You might run into soldiers or mechs.
~ catherine
| (:concerned)... But I can do it.
~ player
| I know you can, but if you don't make it to the bomb we're in trouble.
~ catherine
| (:concerned)...
~ catherine
| Okay. Let's go together - "after the mech"(orange).
