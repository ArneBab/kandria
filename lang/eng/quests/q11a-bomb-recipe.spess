| (:angry)You'd better shake a leg. Altogether {#@islay-nametag} needs "10 blasting caps"(orange) and "20 charge packs"(orange) for the bomb.
| (:sly)Have fun in "Wraw territory"(orange).
~ player
| "I need to "check Wraw factories and warehouses"(orange). I currently have: "{(item-count 'item:blasting-cap)} blasting cap"(orange), "{(item-count 'item:charge-pack)} charge pack"(orange)."(light-gray, italic)

; optional dialogue - symbolic that Fi is kinda sidelined now, as Islay takes charge with the bomb.

~ fi
| (:happy)Well done with the Semi Sisters.
~ player
- Thanks.
  ~ fi
  | (:happy)I'm glad you're safe.
- {#@islay-nametag} did most of the convincing.
  ~ fi
  | Well, she knows {#@innis-nametag} the best I suppose.
  | But without you speaking with them, none of this would've happened.
  ~ player
  - I guess I played my part.
    ~ fi
    | (:happy)An important part. And on dangerous roads.
  - Just doing my job.
    ~ fi
    | (:happy)More than that I think. Especially with how dangerous the roads are now.
  - This was your idea though.
    ~ fi
    | Yes, but you had their ear - and took the journey on dangerous roads.
- It was your idea.
  ~ fi
  | Yes, but you had their ear - and took the journey on dangerous roads.
~ fi
| {#@islay-nametag} told me everything, about why you couldn't call.
| All things considered, it's surprisingly calm around here.
| (:unsure)Everyone's buying into {#@islay-nametag}'s story that we can stop the Wraw. I suppose this bomb is a convincing message.
| (:normal)She's been working {#@catherine-nametag} hard to build it, that much I know. (:happy)At least our weapons are ready.
! label questions
~ player
- You don't think we can win?
  ~ fi
  | {#@islay-nametag} says we have good numbers. (:unsure)But she also says she doesn't know how many the Wraw are.
  | It doesn't fill me with confidence, bomb or no bomb.
  < questions
- What weapons do we have?
  ~ fi
  | We've got some old, pre-Calamity guns that {#@catherine-nametag} and {#@jack-nametag} got working. The Semi Sisters have some too, but in better condition and lots more of them.
  | I don't remember the Wraw having anything like that - they're more into swords and spears, so they can watch you die up close.
  | (:unsure)We've also got scythes, shears, and other sharp farming tools.
  | (:happy)And we've got you.
  ~ player
  - I'll do my best.
    ~ fi
    | (:happy)I know you will.
  - You know it.
    ~ fi
    | (:happy)More than most, I think.
  - [(var 'fight-army) I still can't fight an army.| I can't fight an army.]
    ~ fi
    | You might not have to. (:unsure)I think {#@islay-nametag} has something special planned for you.
  < questions
- What do you think about the bomb?
  ~ fi
  | It's a bold idea, and it might work.
  | (:unsure)But I can't help but worry about the devastation it might cause to this whole area. To our way of life.
  | Though I suppose the Wraw tearing through us would be even worse.
  | (:normal)And I can't say I'm comfortable having a huge explosive assembled in the middle of our camp.
  < questions
- Who's in charge now?
  ~ fi
  | {#@islay-nametag} has the plan, but she's quite diplomatic. (:happy)It feels like a partnership.
  | (:annoyed)I'm not sure {#@innis-nametag} sees it that way though.
  < questions
- I have to go.
  ~ fi
  | If you've got "all the components for the bomb, take them to {#@islay-nametag}"(orange).
  | We'll talk again soon.

~ islay
| I'll take the components to {#@catherine-nametag} so she can finish up.
| {#@fi-nametag}, would you "join me in Engineering"(orange)?
~ fi
| If you insist.
| And what about {(nametag player)}? Since she's the one that brought us together - and brought the components for your bomb.
~ islay
| I was about to add... "could you join us as well, {(nametag player)}"(orange)? This concerns you.
| {#@innis-nametag}, keep an eye on things here.
~ innis
| (:angry)Aye, alright.
