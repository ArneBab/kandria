| - Alex?
|   ~ alex
|   | (:proud)Not for much longer.
| - What are you doing here?
|   ~ alex
|   | (:proud)Biding my time.
| - Are you sober?
|   ~ alex
|   | (:proud)As a judge at the Last Judgement.
  
~ alex
| (:proud)I can't wait to see the look on Fi's face when the Wraw come pouring out of the ground.
~ player
| (:skeptical)...
- What do you mean?
- What have you done?
- Are you saying what I think you're saying?
  ~ alex
  | (:proud)If that's that I've betrayed you to the Wraw, then yeah.
~ alex
| I told them the exact location of the Noka camp.
| (:angry)It's the least I could do to repay you and Fi for your loyalty.
| Now if you don't mind, I've got a battle to fight.
| Watch your back, {#@player-nametag}.

| (:shocked)Alex has... betrayed us? What do you mean?
~ player
| I found them in Cerebat territory. They told the Wraw our location.
| Oh, and they are coming back after all.
~ fi
| (:unsure)They are?
~ player
- Just not how you think.
  ~ fi
  | What do you mean?
  ~ player
  | (:embarassed)They're coming back on the side of the Wraw.
  ~ fi
  | (:shocked)...
- On the side of the Wraw.
  ~ fi
  | (:shocked)...
- We might have to kill them.
  ~ fi
  | What do you mean?
  ~ player
  | (:embarassed)They're coming back on the side of the Wraw.
  ~ fi
  | (:shocked)...
~ jack
| (:annoyed)Why didn't you put 'em outta their misery when you had the chance? Who knows what else they told the Wraw, and how many they might kill.
~ player
- In cold blood?
  ~ jack
  | (:annoyed)Androids don't have blood.
  ~ fi
  | (:annoyed)I beg to differ, Jack.
- I'm not a killer.
  ~ jack
  | (:annoyed)Oh really? What's your body count since you came back online?
  | I bet you've lost count.
  | Not to mention all those you killed before the Calamity.
  ~ fi
  | {#@player-nametag} has helped and defended us. And I will not indulge lazy suppositions!
  ~ jack
  | (:normal)...
- Maybe you're right.
  ~ jack
  | ... 
  ~ fi
  | (:annoyed)No, I don't he is.
~ fi
| I suppose it was better to know this sooner rather than later.
| Thank you, {#@player-nametag}.
