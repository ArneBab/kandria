;; Lore tooltips that can be accessed throughout the entire game - this quest can never be completed; some interactions may alter based on world state conditions.
;; Though maybe we add an achievement for finding and interacting with all of these.
;; Could structure across multiple tasks per region? So when a new region is accessed, it activates a new task full of lore triggers for that region.

  ;; add lore triggers to on-activate - just sprinkle for now, until final level design (activate now, so player can explore freely initially, if they want - or encounter them later)
  ;; occasional branching within, based on world state

  ;; TODO: add more around entire region 1 as the level design and tilesets gets refined

  ;; TIM REPLY: Agreed on power, I'm assuming they use oil for a lot of things. Oil-powered generators too for some electricity too, like the water pumps, walkie-talkies, and phones
