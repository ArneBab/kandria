;; Lore tooltips that can be accessed throughout the entire game - this quest can never be completed; some interactions may alter based on world state conditions.
;; Though maybe we add an achievement for finding and interacting with all of these.
;; Could structure across multiple tasks per region? So when a new region is accessed, it activates a new task full of lore triggers for that region.

rusty puffball
(:giggle)They make clothes out of these? Call me a fashion victim but I wouldn't be seen dead in them.

Why do they look like alien parasites from an old B-movie?

black knight
(:thinking)They remind me of decaying frogspawn. Yet I've never seen decaying frogspawn...

They look like someone's insides if they were on the outside. That's probably what they'd do to you too.
