~ innis
| (:angry)Catherine still isn't here. What's the hold up?
~ player
- I thought you'd have bigger things on your plate.
  ~ innis
  | You mean the Wraw? It's in hand.
  | Now run along - I've nothing more to say to you.
- She isn't coming.
  ~ innis
  | (:angry)Then I hope the Noka will enjoy drinking sand instead of water.
- We need to talk.
  ~ innis
  | (:angry)I've nothing more to say to you.
~ islay
| (:unhappy)Sister! She isn't our enemy. The Noka are not our enemy.
~ innis
| (:angry)You speak out of turn, Islay. Remember who's in charge.
| (:normal)And anyway, this time I dinnae ken why you're here, {#@player-nametag}.
~ player
- I need your help.
  ~ innis
  | (:sly)What? An all-powerful android needs our help?
  | I don't think so. More like Fi needs our help.
- We need your help.
  ~ innis
  | (:sly)More like Fi needs our help, I bet.
  | You don't need our help - you're an android.
- We can help you.
  ~ innis
  | (:pleased)The Noka? Help us? Don't make me laugh.
~ innis
| (:sly)... Don't tell me you care for the Noka.
| I never understood why they gave androids emotions. Nothing but a distraction.
~ islay
| (:unhappy)Listen to her Innis, for Christ's sake!
~ innis
| ...
~ islay
| (:unhappy)The Wraw are at our doorstep. Somehow they're running interference on our systems.
| We're blind, and it's getting darker!
~ innis
| (:angry)... It's not your call, Islay.
~ islay
| (:unhappy)Well why don't you ask the people? They see our cameras shutting down one by one, and our guns sat in storage.
| Just what exactly is your plan, sister?
~ innis
| (:angry)Are you saying you could do better?
~ islay
| (:unhappy)I'm saying we need help. We need the Noka - and we need {#@player-nametag}.
~ innis
| ...
| (:thinking)... Alright. Say we ally with the Noka. Then what?
~ islay
| We pool our resources - our weapons and people.
| We don't know the Wraw's exact numbers and capabilities, but I can hazard a guess from the hunters we sent - at least those that returned.
~ player
| I've seen their mechs and supplies too - it's a lot.
~ islay
| Right. It is. But I think we stand a fighting chance if we work together.
| ... And we abandon our home.
~ innis
| (:angry)No. Never.
~ islay
| It's not forever. But the Wraw are already here, and we can't fight them alone.
| We take what we can carry and leave for the surface. Seal the metro tunnels behind us.
| Everything we leave behind is something the Wraw could use against us.
~ innis
| And what about the bomb?
~ player
- Bomb?
- Now you're talking.
- We blow up the Wraw!
~ islay
| (:expectant)I've improvised an explosive, which could slow their advance.
| We can still use it, but we're missing components to complete it.
~ innis
| Send the android while we evacuate.
~ islay
| (:nervous)Aye, that might work. You'll need to go behind enemy lines.
| In normal times we'd get what we need from the Cerebat markets. But that's obviously not an option any more.
| But \"the Wraw hoard this kind of stuff\"(orange) - they should have plenty lying around.
| (:normal)We need \"wire rolls\"(orange) to make trip wires, \"blasting caps\"(orange) for the detonators, and \"charge packs\"(orange) for the explosive.
| I think \"10 of each\"(orange) should be enough - always prudent to have a few spares. Except \"charge packs: get 20 of those\"(orange), so we have a big enough explosive yield.
| And you'll get paid for your efforts: I'm a trader after all.

~ player
- Thank you.
  ~ islay
  | It's alright - we value your work. I can give you 25 parts per item.
  | But don't thank me yet - this will be dangerous.
- There's no need.
  ~ islay
  | No, I insist. We value your work, and this will be dangerous.
  | I can give you 25 parts per item.
  ~ innis
  | ...
- How much?
  ~ innis
  | (:angry)...
  ~ islay
  | I can give you 25 parts per item.
  ~ player
  - That works.
    ~ islay
    | Okay.
  - Make it 50.
    ~ innis
    | (:angry)Fuck that. And what're ya gonna spend it on when the Wraw have been through here?
    ~ islay
    | If we stop them, life might return to normal.
    | But we can't afford 50 - we need those parts. How about 35? We do value your work, and this will be dangerous.
    ~ player
    - Deal.
      ~ islay
      | Great.
      ! eval (setf (var 'bomb-fee) 35)
      ~ innis
      | (:angry)...
    - Okay I'll be fine with 25.
      ~ innis
      | (:angry)...
      ~ islay
      | Alright then.
    - I've changed my mind: I'll take less than 25.
      ~ islay
      | No, I insist. This won't be easy, and 25 is fair.
      ~ innis
      | (:angry)...
  - I could take a little less, but not much.
    ~ islay
    | No, I insist. We value your work, and this will be dangerous. I think 25 is fair.
    ~ innis
    | ...
~ islay
| (:nervous)But please hurry.
| And remember: we're closing the metro. \"The trains and stations won't be operational.\"(orange)
~ player
| I'll update Fi, then be on my way.
~ innis
| (:sly)That's right, you be a good dog.
~ islay
| (:unhappy)Innis!
| (:nervous)You can't tell Fi - whatever the Wraw are doing to mess with our systems, it affects your FFCS too.
~ player
| \"Checking FFCS...\"(light-gray, italic)
| \"She's right. Shit.\"(light-gray, italic)
~ islay
| I'll explain everything to Fi once we reach the surface. \"Meet us up there once you have the components.\"(orange)
| (:expectant)You got it? This is important.
~ player
- One more time.
  ~ islay
  | Basically we need: \"10 rolls of wire\"(orange), \"10 blasting caps\"(orange), \"20 charge packs\"(orange).
  | You should find them in \"Wraw territory\"(orange). Then \"meet us on the surface\"(orange).
- Got it.
  ~ islay
  | Okay.
| Good luck, {#@player-nametag}.
