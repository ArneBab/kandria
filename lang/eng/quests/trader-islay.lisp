|   | | (:angry)Oi, android. <-Hic->. I 'ear you even stole my jobs around 'ere now too.
|   | | Fucker.
|   | ~ islay
|   | | (:expectant)You could work together Alex, for the Noka. Return to Fi together with Stranger, and get your old life back.
|   | ~ alex
|   | | (:unhappy)\"Stranger\", ha. Don't make me laugh- <-Hic->. I'm the stranger. Stranger to my own people. Stranger to myself.
|   | | I'm going nowhere. Get lost, both of you.
|   | ~ islay
|   | | (:normal)Perhaps it would be best if we leave them alone for a while.
|   | | I suggest you deliver your findings to Fi.
|   | | We'll speak again.

|   | ~ islay
|   | | (:unhappy)Not much better I'm afraid. They're an alcoholic.
|   | | (:normal)I think talking is helping though.
|   | | If I can get them out of this bar it'll be a start.
|   | < talk
| - Why spy on the Noka?
|   ~ islay
|   | (:nervous)We spy on everyone. It's just what we do, it's nothing personal.
|   | (:normal)We have the technology, and the motivation. I don't know if you noticed, but most people down here are trying to kill each other.
|   | For what it's worth I value our friendship with the Noka. Innis does too, in her own way.
|   < talk
| - Can you read my black box?
|   ~ islay
|   | You're curious if you betrayed the Noka.
|   | We know a lot about you - but no, we can't read your black box. No one can any more. I'm sorry.
|   | (:nervous)I saw what happened with the servo robots - whether they acted independently, or were being controlled, it's hard to say.
|   < talk
| - What do you remember from before the Calamity?
|   ~ islay
|   | (:unhappy)It was another world, another lifetime.
|   | (:normal)If you're wondering whether androids destroyed the world, I can't help you.
|   | I wasn't on the surface - (:unhappy)few of us were, that's why we're still here.
|   | (:normal)But I don't see how that would've been possible.
|   | And even if androids did, I doubt very much it was their own doing. No.
|   | No one destroyed humanity except humanity.
|   < talk
| - That'll do.

| - What's happening on the Cerebat border?
|   ~ islay
|   | (:nervous)We're still trying to ascertain that - but we've lost more cameras since you left.
|   | (:normal)Innis thinks we're next, but I'm not so sure.
|   | The Wraw are primitive. Maybe they are messing with the Cerebats, but they wouldn't stand a chance against our technology.
|   | (:expectant)And I'm not just talking about surveillance. We have weapons.
|   ! eval (setf (var 'semis-weapons) T)
|   < talk
| - How's Alex now?
|   ~ islay
|   | (:nervous)They've gone. I don't know where. They just upped and left.
|   | If they've not returned to the Noka then God knows.
|   | I hope they're okay. And sober.
| - Why are the Semis mostly women?
|   ~ islay
|   | (:unhappy)Why not?
|   | (:normal)... Most of us who worked in the factories were women. After the Calamity we just stayed together.
|   | And we've done better than most.
|   | (:happy)Maybe the world wouldn't have fallen apart if more women were in charge.
|   ~ player
|   - TouchÃ©.
|     < talk
|   - You're so right.
|     < talk
|   - What about having kids?
|     ~ islay
|     | We have more than enough men.
|     | Besides, technology can help us with that too.
|     | But not everyone wants kids. I never did.
|     | Some say we should repopulate as quickly as possible. Those with a brain say the world can't support a large population any more.
|     < talk
|   - Let's talk about something else.
|   < talk
| - I need to go.

| ~ player
| - The Wraw are coming.
|   ~ islay
|   | (:nervous)Thank you, but we know. We're making preparations.
|   ~ player
|   - Of course you are.
|     ~ islay
|     | (:happy)...
|     | Good luck, {#@player-nametag}.
|   - What preparations?
|     ~ islay
|     | (:nervous)I'm afraid I can't share that. I'm sorry.
|     | Good luck, {#@player-nametag}.
|   - Good luck.
|     ~ islay
|     | Thank you, {#@player-nametag}. To you too.
|   - Let's talk about something else.
|   < talk
| - Do androids live in the mountains?
|   ~ islay
|   | Oh, that old chestnut.
|   | Before the Calamity there were hundreds of thousands of androids, and and more in production.
|   | Where did they all go? Were they all destroyed? - Present company excepted.
|   | No one knows, and we'll probably never know.
|   | But I doubt they're living in the mountains. We'd have seen or heard something, detected a signal... But there's been nothing.
|   < talk
| - I need to go.
|   < leave
|? (and (complete-p 'q11-recruit-semis) (not (complete-p 'q11a-bomb-recipe)))
| ~ player
| - How will the Semis and Noka work together?
|   ~ islay
|   | We'll talk to Fi, see how many collective weapons and fighters we have, and then reason out a strategy.
|   | It will be crowded, but only for a little while - before we can move back home.
|   ~ player
|   - You're optimistic.
|     ~ islay
|     | (:expectant)Manifesting a positive outcome gives confidence, and improves the chance of success. You should try it.
|   - If you have a home left.
|     ~ islay
|     | (:expectant)Manifesting a positive outcome gives confidence, and improves the chance of success. You should try it.
|   - Do we really have a chance of winning?
|     ~ islay
|     | The numbers say we do.
|     | (:expectant)And besides: manifesting a positive outcome gives confidence, and improves the chance of success.
| - Tell me more about the bomb.
|   ~ islay
|   | It's more an improvised explosive than a bomb from before the Calamity, but it should do the job.
|   | The aim is to collapse the tunnels the Wraw are using to move their troops, while minimising damage to our common infrastructure.
|   | I'm still trying to decide whether one large device, or several smaller ones, will work the best.
|   | I'll figure it out once I get to the surface - maybe Catherine can help.
|   | The components will be the same though, so just make sure you bring what I asked for: \"10 rolls of wire\"(orange), \"10 blasting caps\"(orange), \"20 charge packs\"(orange).
|   | (:happy)And just to be clear, because someone in my lab got confused: blasting caps are NOT a type of exploding mushroom.
| - Are you in charge now?
|   ~ islay
|   | God no. Innis is the leader around here - which is the way we both like it.
|   | I prefer to stand back. But I have her ear, and she listens to me.
| - I need to go.
|   < leave
