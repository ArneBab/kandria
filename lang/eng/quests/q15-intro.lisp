~ islay
| We should detonate the bombs now.
~ fi
| But Zelah's still on the surface.
~ islay
| We do it now, bury the army, then clean up the rest.
~ fi
| Shouldn't we tell the others?
~ islay
| No. We do it while we still have the element of surprise.
~ fi
| If you're sure.
~ islay
| I'm sure.
| (:expectant)Alright, here goes. Sending the signals...
| ...
~ fi
| ...
~ islay
| (:nervous)It didn't work.
~ fi
| (:annoyed)What?... Why?
~ islay
| I don't know.
~ fi
| (:unsure)Could they have defused them?
~ islay
| I don't think so. Not this quickly.
| And I think the signal is getting through; their comms interference isn't running yet - Zelah's probably talking to his own people.
| (:unhappy)Fuck.
| Someone needs to go down there.
~ player
- I'll go.
  ~ fi
  | (:happy)...
- That's what I'm here for.
  ~ fi
  | (:happy)...
- Lucky me.
~ islay
| No. You don't know enough about the bombs. (:nervous)It has to be \"Catherine\"(orange)...
~ fi
| (:unsure)... There must be another way.
~ player
- Some of the bombs are hard to reach.
  ~ islay
  | Then we need to find a way.
- Teach me how to check them.
  ~ islay
  | (:nervous)There's no time. And it's too risky if you can't figure it out.
- What about Jack?
  ~ fi
  | ...
  ~ islay
  | He doesn't know anything about the bombs.
~ islay
| You can go with her though, {#@player-nametag}. To protect her.
~ fi
| ...
~ islay
| Please \"go and fetch her\"(orange).
