| (:grin)Aha! We are back in business.
| Now I feel like they should pay for crossing "The Synthesis"(yellow).
~ player
- Now you tell me about the old world.
  ~ synthesis
  | (:grin)You can see for yourself - once it's safe.
- Is that your name?
  | (:grin)My name. And my purpose. In the meantime...
- Who should pay?
  ~ synthesis
  | Bandits. Rogues. Headless Highwaymen. Whatever they call them around here.

| They are looking for this information too, and they got close.
| (:grin)But I took pre-emptive action: hit their camp on the Semi border. Hit it hard. Most ended, but some escaped.
| Their new camp is "low-east of here, in the middle of this region"(orange).
| They want to end me. But if I die, so does my knowledge.
| You're going to "kill them for me"(orange).
~ player
- I am?
  ~ synthesis
  | (:grin)You are if you want to know more.
- How do I know they're the bad guys and not you?
  ~ synthesis
  | (:grin)You don't.
- Here's where we part ways.
  ~ synthesis
  | (:grin)If it has to be like that.
  | But "my offer still stands"(orange). Us outcasts, we should stick together.
