| Actually, I do have a "little project you could help with"(orange), if you have time.
| It's on the down-low, but I think it could be our saviour: "wind power"(orange)!
| (:excited)I don't know if you noticed, but it can get pretty windy on the surface - stormy even. I want to "build turbines"(orange) and use the wind to produce electricity.
| Pretty sweet, huh?
~ player
- Count me in.
- Like in the old world?
  ~ catherine
  | (:excited)Right! I've heard about those massive windmills.
  | (:normal)These would be more modestly sized though.
  ~ player
  - I'm interested.
  - I'll pass for now.
    < leave
- Not now, sorry.

~ catherine
| First thing I'm gonna need is some essential components: "anemometers"(orange), "disc brakes"(orange), "transformers"(orange).
| Call it "5 of each"(orange) I think, just to get me started. I can "pay you"(orange).
| The "Semis should have some lying around"(orange). The "Cerebats too - they've already got turbines in their wind tunnels"(orange).
| Thanks, {(nametag player)}.

; there's an implication here that there'll be more stages to this quest, and that the player may eventually see the windmills assembled; but neither happens, due to the confirmation of the Wraw invasion of the entire valley (q10-wraw) - this itself is part of the tragedy of the story
; if the player does this quest, or any other quest where Catherine refers to them by name (such as sq1-leaks), after changing their name in q7, then how has Catherine gotten word so quickly to use their new name, if you've come straight from Fi? Can assume Fi let people know quickly. And I don't really want to limit use of the player's new name to avoid this, as it's a cool reflection of the player's choice
